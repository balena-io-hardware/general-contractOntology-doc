Where to start?

"I have an application/deployment, it requires X - give me an sbc that does it" - question asked to an oracle (all knowing entity)
"We reserve the right to disregard specifics of customer requests"

"customer is offered selection of requirements for their application (not just the 'app' but the 'deployment') - we must be able to provide a list of things that fulfill that request"
--- eg. form that allows selection from discrete list of options, defined by us

"relatively flat ontology" - 
- hdmi example - broad capability of "hdmi" - however if requirements start popping up for HDMI 1.2, it can be added as a new capability

"concept of user (or order form?) as a contract"
- user has capabilities such as 'mains voltage'
- must evaluate to zero remaining requirements


example:



Questions
-- does the "type" field force a validation against the type definition
